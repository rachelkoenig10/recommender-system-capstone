       "'This is a great tutu and at a really great price. It doesn\\'t look cheap at all. I\\'m so glad I looked on Amazon and found such an affordable tutu that isn\\'t made poorly. A++ I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for dance class, she wore it today for the first time and the teacher thought it was adorable. I bought this to go with a light blue long sleeve leotard and was happy the colors matched up great. Price was very good too since some of these go for over $15.00 dollars. What can I say... my daughters have it in orange, black, white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one. It is a very good way for exalt a dancer outfit: great colors, comfortable, looks great, easy to wear, durables and little girls love it. I think it is a great buy for costumer and play too. We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult. Thank you Halo Heaven great product for Little Girls.  My Great Grand Daughters Love these Tutu\\'s.  Will buy more from this seller.  Made well and cute on the girls.  Thanks for a great product.NEVER BUY FROM DRESS UP DREAMS........I will buy more as long as I don\\'t buy from &#34;Dress Up Dreams&#34;  I never rec\\'d or order in FL. Only rec\\'d pink, the purple one was missing.  Company is a rip off.  REFUSES to make good on purchase...... Real creeps. I received this today and I\\'m not a fan of it but my daughter is I thought it would be puffier as it looks in the pic but it\\'s not and the one they sent me is pink underneath and the waist band is pink which is not what I wanted due to the fact she already had the sandals she was gonna wear with it now I gotta find another pair of sandals,ima just keep it cuz she likes it. Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear. So far, she\\'s using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure we\\'ll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon. The quality is just fine for the price we paid. I was not expecting a designer skirt for this price and got exactly what I paid for. Great tutu for a great price. It isn\\'t a &#34;full&#34; or high quality skirt, but it is perfect for my daughter to wear over leggings for her little outfits. My daughter liked this, and it with her costume, but she would have liked it to be a bit fuller. For what I paid for two tutus is unbeatable anywhere!  I ordered a pink and turquios and they are vibrant and beautiful! The tutu is very full! Princess style! Not cheaply made! Not cheap materia! Obviously someone made these with love and care! I paid less than 7 bucks for a tutu I and I feel proud of my self for researching to the point of finding gold!Recommend 2-6 years!My daughter is two ! Wears size 4t and this skirt ( one size ) fit perfect and will probaly be able to accommodate her quickly growing waist for some time! Wonder my niece wears it every single day, yellow is her favorite color right now an this cute little tutu made he da. It is well built and we hope she gets lots of wear out of it. My daughter has worn this skirt almost every day since she received it and it\\'s even been through the washer along with the other clothes.  It\\'s amazing quality!  She fits a 4T and it\\'s just above her knee, and has a little bit of growing room, although I\\'m not so sure as much as others are saying.  But considering how often she wears it, I\\'m not worried! ;) Purchased this tutu for my granddaughter\\'s first birthday.  It fit nicely with room to grow in.  I\\'m very please with it and will purchase more in varying colors in the future. Full and well stitched.  This tutu is a beautiful purple color that looks just like the picture.  It looks just adorable on our little fairy. This was a gift for a two year old and a five year old.  The girls squealed upon opening the box, they grabbed the tutus, put them on, and wore them the rest of the day.  The tutus seem to be well made, and can stand up to handling by little princesses.  I recommend these tutus. My 3yr old loved this tutu skirt in pink! Was hoping to order more in different colors.She had hardly used this,the stitching came apart in 2weeks.now it\\'s lying in her closet..Altogether she wore it like 4-5 times for 20 mins or so.wish the stitching was of better quality to hold up while little ones wear it. Can\\'t recommend. Perfect for my budding grand daughter ballerina! Beautiful vibrant color.  Fits great and easy to  clean!  I bought several more colors! Never GOT this item - but gave a 1 STAR because the replies from the SUPPLIER was GREAT.They tried to send the item more than once.My $ was refunded in a timely manner too.It was a shame I never got it for my daughter - it would of looked great with her OUTFIT for Dr. Seuss WEEK at school.Most original.Maybe next time. Nice and puffy tutu skirt. I would recommend this for girls under 10 yr. old.  It will be too short and small for older girls. Bought this for my niece as part of her fairy outfit.  She loves it and wears it all the time.  Well made for the price. My 4 year old daughter always wants to play dress up. I bought this for her for Christmas and she never wanted to take it off. It is almost a year later and she still has it!! It was well worth the money and has held up this long with nothing wrong with it!! I would recommend it Our granddaughters are all very girlie, so when the youngest one received this for Christmas, they all wanted it!  Great color and fit for a 2 year old as well as her aunt who is 30!  I would recommend this tutu for all little girls. Prompt delivery, and it is exactly as described.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven\\'t washed it yet- so I don\\'t know how it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :)  She\\'s on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!  The elastic waist will expand with her as she grows.  Great tutu-  not cheaply made Very Cute!! I have buy more than one Adorable, Sturdy Grammy\\'s Angels Love it It\\'s ok Great for dress-up and for ballet practice Great value Good WOW !! ..is all I have to say! Wonderful and great shipping. Excellent quality! Wonderful tutu! Great Tutu Great tutu for little girls! Came apart in 2weeks! So cute! Never GOT IT.... Nice skirt must have for a fairy princess My daughter loved it Sassy!

Rosetta Stone software is fun to use Great way to obtain functional conversation in a new language Great software, not so fun to install, and headset low quality A Neat System of Learning, A BIt Pricey Really nice refresher, unable to get microphone aspect to work Rosetta Stone - Excellent way to learn! Fun and effective Becoming Bilingual ',\n",
       " 'all_reviews': 'Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there\\'s not always time for that either. Sometimes there\\'s just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don\\'t want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That\\'s where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it\\'s interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you\\'ve learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don\\'t end up missing anything along the way. I\\'m more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people. The product itself is five stars, however the description is faulty.  I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first.  I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an \"App for that\", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.  For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour.  On day 91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying \"no course found for this account\".  The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion of the product was just a free trial.  If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription.  No where on this product page does it say that the companion apps are a trial version.  I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, \"Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone. Three month access included with purchase.\"  I personally think it is still obscure since the part about the mobile companion is much farther down in the description but at least it is something. The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum. I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to use the program in other locations.  However, Rosetta Stone\\'s immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home.  Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn\\'t a problem for me yet it\\'s something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules. I feel the need for this and can source it out separately, but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom.* Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns. Okay, I admit it. I\\'m one of the millions of Americans that massively struggles with any language either than English. I have recently returned to college to finish out my Bachelors. The university I\\'m enrolled in requires two years of a foreign language. Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now. BUT with using Rosetta, I was not only able to get through my class without sounding and feeling like an idiot, but I actually got A\\'s!! I never thought that was a possibility. I\\'m not ready to jet off to France or anything but I\\'m not a complete moron any more either. I\\'m calling that a huge success. Once this whole bachelors things is under my belt, I will be back to pick up the next level!! I bought this product a little over a year ago. Now that I am done with it, I wanted to sell it. I put it on eBay and Craigslist. They had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable, so you can\\'t sell it as a used item after you\\'re done with it.Total crap ! I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone software; it\\'s easy and fun to use.  The Rosetta Stone \"dynamic immersion\" method is different than traditional methods where you see a word in English and then see a word in the new language to memorize.  L\\'&eacute;tude du franais est r&eacute;ellement amusement et facile! I\\'ve never had french, learned french, or know anything about French. Now, however, I feel like I could do OK with a quick trip and to get around conversationally. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning, but it\\'s pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn\\'t focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn\\'t contain a whole lot- It\\'s obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you\\'re *really* interested, it\\'s worth it.For it\\'s purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this. La Femme Boit...... I think that means the girl drinks. Learned that in the first 5 minutes. :)Ok, overall the program is good. This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn\\'t I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don\\'t think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don\\'t want to have to install the application and then a language pack. The software should be smart enough to install both the app and language pack together to make the process even easier.And yes, I am a software developer so when I review software I look at it from a complete implementation standpoint. Software is only as good as the installer. The Rosetta Stone process gets you involve through what they call immersion right away, and I found it quite fun.  You run the application and learning CD\\'s through your computer, plug in your headset/microphone to the USB port, enroll on line for the web support and community and off you go.You can hear it, see it, see how your respond, and it pretty much sweeps you along and gets you quite involved.  I have learned languages(the Romance languages) traditionally in school and self-taught over the years, and I found Rosetta very helpful and engaging.The negatives are the price, and this is only Level One.  It\\'s a fine start, but if you\\'re serious, you\\'re going to have to do a lot more work and dish out for the next level.  Your call!May I suggest, for quick learning, say for a trip: get a tape/cd and a book.  Learn the quick, important phrases, practice some everyday- use it, use it, use it- hear it and say it, and if you can, practice with a native speaker- you really learn that way, and you get over the nervousness of being ignorant about the language and constantly fretting about making mistakes.If you\\'re willing to pay the price and put in time- some of us just love computer, and it also includes an Audio CD for practice elsewheres, the Rosetta Stone French will give you a good, fun start into French or any new language. I have had this product for a while to evaluate because I have so enjoyed the format and the refresher course. I have 7 years of high school and college French but like so many Americans, I never learned to speak or aurally interpret native speech properly. I found the visual and sound exercises extremely helpful and enjoyable. I have been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on \"French\" and actually understand much of what being said. I\\'m not sure I\\'d learn formal French grammar this way but I don\\'t think that is the point of the course.I was disappointed that I could not get the speech recognition microphone function to work despite many weeks of attempts, use of customer service and other techie help. My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was never able to get that working. Even so, the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills. Merci!Based upon this experience, I\\'d definitely consider buying the next course if I could be assured the voice recognition piece would work. Bring French to life!If your child is taking their first year of French or you are ready to head off on vacation and want to learn the language yourself, Rosetta Stone is a great learning tool for you both!  Version 4 comes with the learning lessons, headset with mic, app to use with your iPhone or iPod Touch for on the go learning and access to a virtual community online for lessions, games and chat!  I really don\\'t think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is that I didn\\'t know about this product sooner! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as well! I got this product for my sister who enjoyed taking 4 years of French in high school.  Here is what she had to say about the product:>>>THIS IS AMAZING! I loved working with this product! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly, and it was fun to do. They show you pictures and then show you the French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills. I would highly recommend this product to my fellow peers! I am excited to try French Level 2 and learn even more!&lt;&lt;&lt;I asked her if she had tried any other language learning products that she could compare it to and she said she had not, but she was very happy with this. .When in the military,  I was stationed in Europe for several years.  The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: \"What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.  Then I will tell them I am \"quadri lingual.\".  Do you think that will work? . . . Neither do I. ',\n",
